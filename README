Install
=======
* risc IRC bot standalone:

First copy the folder risc in a place you want, it actually doesn't matter, say /home/your_name. 
risc makes use of its own db to store several things, like keeping an admin list or other config stuff.
Thus you need to create a db, and report it later in the config file. The best is to create a new user 
for risc, and grant it basic privileges to b3 / server dbs, and of course, its config db.

Now you also need to setup the configuration. The config file is named "risc.example.ini". Rename it to 'risc.ini',
remove the comments and set it up. Be careful using 
it: let a space where there is one and let no space where there isn't, this is very important. 
Take a look at risc.example.ini to get you started. Copy it, rename to "risc.ini", and change whatever you need to.

Finaly you can run the bot with the script provided: user@host $./run-screen.sh. This will run the bot 
inside a screen session on the server, so that, even when the SSH connection is closed, it will keep 
running in the background.

* riscb3 plugin:

copy riscb3.py to @b3/extplugins
copy riscb3.ini to @b3/explugins/conf

add the following line to the plugin section of your b3.xml file:
<plugin name="riscb3" config="@b3/extplugins/conf/riscb3.ini" />

You need to setup the riscb3.ini too:

The calladmin section is simply about the calladmin command.

The db section contains info about the database of your server. Basically, there should be the same info as in risc.ini.
Use the same user:passwd, set the name of your b3 db for this server, and the name of a table, which will be used to store info
and runtime stuff for this specific server.
